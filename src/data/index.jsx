export const about =
  "I'm a third year engineering student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science, Indore. I like to code cool things and showcase them online. I enjoy building fullstack websites and sometimes android apps with flutter. My primary focus is towards backend development. I also spend time creating generative digital art and simulations using frameworks like three.js, WebGL, OpenGL and SFML. I like to explore and try out new technologies and currently I'm focusing on building something cool with java.";
